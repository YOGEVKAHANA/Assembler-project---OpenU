# Assembler-project---OpenU
hardware of project - 

The computer in the project consists for CPU, registers and RAM memory.
Some of the memory is used as a stack.
The processor has 8 general registers (r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8)
The size of each register is 24 bits
The least significant bit is indicated as bit number 0 and the most significant as number 23.
The names of the register are always written with a small letter 'r'

The memory size is 2 ^ 21.
At 0-2 ^ 21-1 and each cell is 24 bits in size a memory cell is also called the "word" the bits in each word are numbered as in the register
This computer only works with numbers integers, positive and negative
Real numbers are not supported
In addition there is support for characters represented by ascii code.
